/*   I changed the color definitions for links to match what we do on our
       corporate website.  I had to add "a:visited:hover" to the default 
       link definitions (Webworks didn't include it) to make sure the 
       hover color was the same for both visited links and unvisited links.
       This was proving quite difficult to diagnose as in my testing all of the
       links were visited, so I wasn't seeing any change in color when I set
       a color for "a:link:hover". */
