It handles a wide range of graphic tasks, from simple form-based graphical user interfaces to complex real-time vectorial applications managing hundreds of thousands of objects simultaneously. Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views can accomplish all of this because of its advanced architecture, emphasizing separation of behavioral and graphical aspects along with high-level abstractions for easily managing many objects. This architecture also provides for a common set of services across all interfaces, including PostScript dumping, event recording and playback, and object persistence in files. </div><div id="ww10277" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is powerful.</span> Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views starts where Microsoft® Windows® systems and the Open Software Foundation’s Motif® leave off. You can create a window or a simple widget with Microsoft Windows and Motif, but you cannot create a graph, draw a map, manage a spreadsheet, or animate thousands of objects. With Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views you can display thousands of animated objects at once.</div><div id="ww8112" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is efficient.</span> Low memory requirements and optimal data structures allow for extremely fast execution. Quadtrees manage display updates for hundreds or thousands of objects. Double buffering provides flicker-free animation. Optimal memory allocation and minimal objects with shared components mean that even the biggest applications will not swap.</div><div id="ww8116" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is simple.</span> High-level graphic objects mean less tedious coding. Do you need a grapher? Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views 2D Graphics Professional has a grapher class. Do you need bar charts, scatter plots, and gauges? Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views has a dedicated product for charts. Spreadsheets? A snap with Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views’ matrix class in the Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views Controls Standard product. These and many other high-level classes give you the capability you need to quickly write your interface.</div><div id="ww8132" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is extensible.</span> Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views is written in exemplary C++ style. The class hierarchy and internal protocol are well-documented, which means you can write new classes derived from the documented Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views classes. Code reuse is at the center of object-oriented development, and Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views lets you take full advantage of it.</div><div id="ww8814" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is portable.</span> Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views is not specific to any one environment or platform. It has been tested and used in many C++ development environments and can be integrated into numerous graphical environments as well. Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views applications work transparently in Windows, Motif, or Xlib. Its use of graphic primitives lets you write code independently of the underlying window system. A single application, for example, can be integrated into both Windows (PC) and Motif (UNIX). You can change the look-and-feel of the display between these two environments by simply calling a Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views function. </div><div id="ww10409" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is ready to use.</span>  Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views provides easy-to-use GUI editors and scores of predefined objects including gadgets, graphic objects, behaviors, charts, and gauges, as well as spreadsheet functionality and robust graph, drawing, and formula editors. A Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views package includes a complete class hierarchy of gadgets: interactive objects targeted for specific uses with flexible graphic representations and predefined behavior. Gadgets include scroll bars, menu bars, buttons, and so on. Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views lets you mix basic drawing primitives and interactive gadgets together to produce intuitive, decorated interfaces.</div><div id="ww10425" class="Body">Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views<span class="bold"> is modular.</span> Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views is available as several products, each of which is specialized in a particular GUI area: GUI controls, advanced 2D graphics, graph layout, maps, charts, and so on. Each product is provided with its libraries, Studio extensions, samples, and comprehensive documentation. You can assemble just the Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views capabilities you need, while allowing for future growth with the option of integrating additional Rogue Wave&nbsp;Views products as your application needs warrant.</div><footer><!-- Related Topics --><!--                --><!-- Disqus --><!--        --><!-- Google Translation --><!--                    --><div class="ww_skin_page_globalization"><div id="google_translate_element">&nbsp;</div><script><!--
