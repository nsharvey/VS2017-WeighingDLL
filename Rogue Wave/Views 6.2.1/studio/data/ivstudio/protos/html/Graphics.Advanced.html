<h1>Graphic Attributes</h1>
<P>
The pane on the left lets you edit several properties of the
graphic objects in your prototype. For each graphic object you can change:
<ul>
<li><em>Name</em>: In order to give more meaningful
names to each of the graphic objects.
<li><em>Visibility</em> ("V" button on each line): Allows you to
make the object visible or invisible. Additional behaviors can make the
object appear or disappear on request.
<li><em>Hidden in application</em> ("H" button): Specifies that the
graphic objects remain visible when editing the prototype or panel in 
PrStudio, but will be hidden in the final application. This can be useful
when inserting intermediate graphic nodes such as those in the operations 
prototype library.
<li><em>Grapher Node</em> ("N" button): Specifies that the given graphic node is
to behave as a graphic node when placed in an IlvGrapher. Therefore, links can be traced
between the object and other grapher nodes. <em>This property is not implemented
for groups encapsulated in IlvProtoGraphic</em>s.
<li><em>Transformed</em> ("T" button): Specifies that the graphic object is included in a
transformed object. This means the object will keep its original 
coordinates intact, thereby avoiding degradations if geometric transformations are applied
repeatedly. It is suggested that objects be
transformed by default, to avoid degradation if the prototype is misused. 
However, this requires slightly more memory.
<li><em>Bounded Size</em> ("B" button): Specifies that the graphic node
should maintain the same size whenever its view is zoomed in or out.
If minimum zoom and maximum zoom are set but not Bounded Size, the
object will disappear instead of being zoomed whenever the views zoom
level reaches minimum or maximum thresholds.
<li><em>Minimum zoom</em> level ("mZ" field): Specifies the
minimum size the object can be zoomed to.
<li><em>Maximum zoom</em> level ("MZ" field): Specifies the maximum 
size the object can be zoomed to.
<li><em>Layer</em> ("L" field): Specifies the layer on which the graphic
objects will be placed. This lets you set a reliable order for all graphic
objects in a group.
</ul>
