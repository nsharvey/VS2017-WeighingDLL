<h1>View Menu</h1>
Items in the View menu allow you to select what types of attributes you want to
edit from a given group or prototype:
<ul>
<li><em>Interface</em> lets you access and edit all the attributes defined
for the group or prototype. This is the default presentation.
<li><em>Public Attributes</em> shows only the public attributes of the
prototype, that is, those that the other objects and the application
can see.
<li><em>Modified Values</em> lists the values of a prototype instance that
differ from its prototype. These values will be saved 
together with the prototype instance.
<li><em>All Values</em> lists all the prototype values and subvalues.
These values can be modified, but this does not mean that the 
modifications will be saved with the prototype, if some other
behaviors override the given settings.
</ul>
