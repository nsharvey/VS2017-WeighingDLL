<h1>Defining the Graphic Behavior</h1>

Next, you should define the graphic behaviors of your prototype, 
that is, how the modification of each attribute affects 
the visual aspect of your prototype. For each attribute, 
you can add behaviors, that is, instructions that will be performed each 
time the value is modified.
<P><P>
To add a behavior, <b>select an attribute</b> in the list. Then, 
in the <b>Control menu</b> or the <b>Display menu</b>, 
select a behavior to add. 
<P>
<ul>
<li><em>Control</em> behaviors allow a change of an attribute
to trigger other changes of other attributes, conditionally or not.
For instance, if you want a thermometer to appear red when the 
temperature is above a given threshold, add a <a href="IlvConditionAccessor">
Condition accessor</a> on the temperature attribute that assigns red to the
foreground value of the gauge.
<li><em>Display</em> behaviors allow you to change graphic
properties of the objects, such as rotation, zoom, and visibility, or perform
animations of objects.
</ul>
<P>
In addition, you can have attributes notify others of their changes,
so that the graphic appearance of the group or prototype can be fully
adjusted when one attribute changes its value. The <a href="IlvOutputAccessor">
notify</a> behavior can tell other attributes watching it that they 
should execute their behavior, while the <a href="IlvConnectAccessor"> 
watch</a> behavior allows one attribute to indicate that it observes another attribute.
<P><P>
Finally, you can:
<ul>
<li> Add intermediate or hidden attributes that will be used
in intermediate states of the computation. Select <em>Edit->New Attribute</em>
to add an attribute.
<li>Delete selected attributes, behaviors, or parameters with <em>Edit->Delete</em>
<li>Move behaviors up or down. Behaviors are triggered from the top to the bottom.
You can decide in which order they are triggered.
</ul>
