<h1>Delegate to Prototype</h1>
This function lets you add predefined attributes and behaviors
coming from a chosen prototype.
<P><P>
After selecting <b>Edit->Delegate To Prototype</b>, choose in the list the
prototype whose behavior you want to inherit. A new attribute is created,
and the inherited attributes are shown in the table grayed-out.
<P><P>
You cannot edit directly these inherited attributes, but you
can reference them in other attributes.
<P><P>
Some inherited attributes may reference other attributes or
graphic nodes. Therefore, not every behavior can be inherited into
any prototype.
