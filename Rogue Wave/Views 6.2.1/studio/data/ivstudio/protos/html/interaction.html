<h1>Defining the Interactive Behavior</h1>

Next, you can add user behaviors, that is, how user actions
affect the attributes of your prototype. 

<ul>
<li>If the user action comes from a callback, select 
<b>Event->Callback</b> to add a behavior that will be triggered 
by some objet interactor and callback.
<li>Otherwise, to handle user events such as button clicks 
directly, select <b>Event->Event</b> to add a behavior that will
be triggered by simple user events.
</ul>
<P>
Next, enter the parameters for each added behavior.
<P><P>
Once you have added the triggering accessor, you can add 
Behaviors that will be triggered by the user action
by adding <b>Control-><em>item</em></b> or <b>Display-><em>item</em></b> 
behaviors. 
<P>
It is generally a good idea to have the interaction accessors 
modify only the public attributes of your prototype, relying on their 
modification to update all the display behaviors.
