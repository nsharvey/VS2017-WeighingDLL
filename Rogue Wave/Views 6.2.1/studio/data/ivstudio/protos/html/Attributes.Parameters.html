<h1>Attribute Flags</h1>
Several properties can be set on an attribute:
<P>
<ul>
<li><em>Public</em> (button "P" in the editor): The attribute
is visible by outside objects. Attributes are public by default,
but you can hide the attributes that are used only to perform internal
computations.
<li><em>Persistent</em> (button "R" in the editor): The attribute value
will be stored when the group is saved, allowing it to be restored to the last
value set by the user. By default, attributes are persistent. To optimize 
reading and writing, or to always restore them to the original state
of the prototype when a file is read, you can set them to non-persistent.
<li><em>Notifying</em> (button "N" in the editor): When the attribute is set,
it can notify other attributes that it has changed its value, and therefore
allow updates of other attributes. See the 
<a href="IlvOutputAccessor">Notify</a> behavior documentation.
</ul>
