<h1>Defining the Graphic Representation</h1>

You should now create your prototype presentation, by adding
graphic objects in the <b>prototype buffer window</b>, unless you 
have already started by drawing before defining the attributes.
<P><P>
The pane on the left allows you to edit several properties of the
graphic objects:
<ul>
<li>Each node <em>name</em>, to give more meaningful
names to each of the graphic objects.
<li><em>Visibility</em> ("V" button on each line) allows you to
make the object visible or invisible. Additional behaviors can make the
object appear or disappear on request.
<li><em>Transformed</em> ("T" button) specifies that the graphic object is included in a
transformed object.
<li>The other properties are defined in the <a href="Graphics.Advanced">Advanced properties</a>
page.
</ul><P>
Once you have added objects, you may go back to the previous
page to define new attributes that reference the internal nodes,
or move forward to define dynamic behaviors for the prototype.
