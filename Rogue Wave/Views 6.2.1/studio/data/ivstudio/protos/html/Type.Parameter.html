<h1>Attribute Types</h1>
All attributes are typed: the type indicates the kind of values
the attribute can be assigned to, which helps determine its meaning. 
A type can be a:
<ul>
<li><em>value</em>: The attribute holds a value that can be set or queried directly
(a string, a color, an integer, and so on) 
<li><em>reference</em>: A reference to another internal attribute of the group.
For instance, creating an attribute named 'temperature' and
having it reference the 'value' attribute of a 'slider' graphic object allows
you to access the 'value' internal attribute of the gauge under the more appropriate
name--'temperature'--if the group is to represent a thermometer.
This is equivalent to a pointer or an alias in a programming language.
<li><em>script</em>: A script is executed. This script should return a value, 
which defines the attribute. Use the <a href="displayb">
Behavior</a> page to change the name of the function that defines the value.
<li><em>group</em>ing of attributes: Given an attribute name, 
all subattributes of the same name in the group will be assigned to the 
same value. For instance, creating an attribute named "foreground" 
and giving it a type of "group" will create an attribute that will set the 
foreground of all objects contained in the group to the same value.
<li><em>none</em>: Some attributes can be purely functional, 
and therefore be untyped. However, if an attribute as neither a type nor a behavior, it
cannot exist. <em>Therefore, setting a type of "none" to an attribute after
creating it is equivalent to deleting the attribute.</em>
</ul>
