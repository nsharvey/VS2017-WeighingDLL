		<p>An example of how to extend an <code>IlvTable</code> that can
	be used in a specialized graphic object.</p>
		<img src="png/prime.png"/>
		<p>This sample displays a grid where each filled square indicates a 
	prime number. The top left cell corresponds to the value
	<code>1</code>.<br/>
	There are more visible cells if you enlarge the window.<br/>
	The grid is an instance of a new graphic class,
	called <code>PrimeTable</code>, inheriting from
	<code>IlvFilledRectangle</code>. It uses a subclass of 
	<code>IlvTable</code> that implements its
	<code>drawItem</code> member function by testing whether
	the indicated cell corresponds to a prime number.<br/>
	If you click with the left button on a cell, the value of the cell is
	displayed in a small pop-up menu. This is achieved by a
	specialized <code>IlvInteractor</code> set on the
	<code>PrimeTable</code> instance.
      <p>For demonstration purposes, this sample code uses portable GUI 
      elements from the Gadgets package of the Rogue Wave Views suite. 
      Feel free to use these elements in your application if you have 
      a license for Rogue Wave Views or for Rogue Wave Views Controls. 
      This information applies to the classes located in the library <code>ilvgadgt</code>, 
      listed in the README file that you can find in the installation directory.</p>
