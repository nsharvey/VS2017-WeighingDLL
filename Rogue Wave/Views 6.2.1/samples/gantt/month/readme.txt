  A Gantt chart shows customized scales, grids, line graphics, and link
  graphics.

  to customize the scale management (updateScale and createScale methods) and
  how to customize the drawing of the grid (drawGrid method).

  The source file also shows how to define graphic models for the Gantt chart
  lines and how to define a graphic model for the Gantt chart links.
