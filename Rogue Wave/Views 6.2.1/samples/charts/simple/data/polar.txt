This sample shows how to create a chart using a polar projector. To do so, it uses the 
IlvPolarChart class. Note the two different scale types: rectangular for the rho 
coordinate that is displayed radially, and circular for the theta coordinate. Two 
callback functions are used as input data and are rendered with two displayers: A 
polygon representation and a bar representation.
