This sample demonstrates the cycle scrolling feature of the Charts package. When new points are added and 
cannot be displayed on the right side of the chart, they are translated to the left side of the chart, where 
the minimum x-value is replaced by the previous maximum x-value. Previous data points are therefore dropped. 
Note how the x-scale values are updated to match the real translation. The color of the new markers depends 
on the actual values they represent.
