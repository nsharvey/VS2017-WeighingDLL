This sample shows you how to use a logarithmic scale in a chart. The logarithmic scale is created by setting 
a transformer (instance of IlvSimpleChartTransformer) on the associated coordinate. It is then added as the 
second ordinate axis of the chart and positioned at the right side of the data display area. The first ordinate 
does not use any coordinate transformation.
