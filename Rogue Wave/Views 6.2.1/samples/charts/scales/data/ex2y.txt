This sample shows you how to use a chart with two ordinate scales,  and how to connect each scale to one or several 
displayers. It creates a Cartesian chart connected to four random data sets. Each data set is rendered by a displayer 
connected to the first (left) ordinate axis (the type of displayer used is IlvMarkedPolylineChartDisplayer). A stacked 
displayer (IlvStacked3dBarChartDisplayer) is then used to render the 4 data sets and is connected to the second 
(right) ordinate axis.
