  panel.

  You can either:

    * Make a selection in the table part: cell, row(s) or column(s) and look at
      its properties on the right: cell position, row(s) number or column(s)
      number selected

      watch its result on the table part

  Data cannot be modified in the table Gadget; only new rows can be added
  (yellow row). To modify data, you need to use the above fields.

  When selecting a row, the Age field is in bold font if its value is under 19
  and the sex is displayed in red for a woman.
