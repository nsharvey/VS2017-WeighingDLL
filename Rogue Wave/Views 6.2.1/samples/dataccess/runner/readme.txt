Sample: 'runner'
----------------
  This sample defines a generic Data Access application that can read an .iva
  file.

  This C++ sample:

    * Creates all panels described in it and let the end-user interact with
      these panels.

    * Allows to connect to a database

    * This sample behaves in a way similar to the test mode of an application
      in Studio.
