2. LICENSE GRANTS.

2.1 Development License Grant.
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, and
  upon payment of the applicable fees, Rogue Wave grants to Licensee a
  nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual, limited right and license to
  permit Licensed Developers to install and use the Licensed Software in
  object code form for the sole purpose of creating and testing
  Applications.  In connection with this license, Licensee may make or
  have made one copy of the Licensed Software for back-up or disaster
  recovery purposes, provided, that Rogue Wave's copyright notice and
  other proprietary rights notices are reproduced on the copy.

2.2 Use License Grant.
  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, and
  upon payment of the applicable fees, Rogue Wave grants to Licensee a
  nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual, limited right and license to
  permit Licensed Users to use the Licensed Software, as embedded in
  Applications developed by Licensed Developers, on Licensed Devices
  located at facilities owned by Licensee or contractors under
  Licensee's control, solely for Licensee's internal business purposes.
  In connection with this license, Licensee may copy or have copied the
  Licensed Software embedded in or used in the execution of an
  Application as necessary for the purpose of exercising the rights
  granted under this Section, provided that Licensee may not remove any
  copyright notice or other proprietary rights notices contained in the
  Licensed Software.


3. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS AND LICENSEE RESPONSIBILITIES. 

3.1 Development Restrictions.
  The development rights granted to Licensee in Section 2.1 may only
  be exercised by individual developers employed by or under contract
  to Licensee that Licensee has designated as "Licensed Developers"
  and for whom Licensee has paid the applicable development license
  fees.  With regard to individual or node-locked developer licenses,
  if one Licensed Developer ceases to be employed by or under contract
  to Licensee or permanently ceases work on projects involving the
  Licensed Software, then Licensee may designate an alternate
  developer to replace such Licensed Developer at no additional cost.
  However, individual or node-locked development licenses may not be
  used by numerous developers in shifts.  Conversely, concurrent or
  floating development licenses may be used by any number of
  individuals so long as the maximum number of individuals using the
  Licensed Software at any time does not exceed the number of
  concurrent or floating development licenses purchased.  Licensee may
  not create a programmatic interface that makes use of the Licensed
  Software application programming interfaces for use by any party
  other than Licensed Developers and must ensure that persons other
  than Licensed Developers do not have programmatic access to the
  Licensed Software either directly or indirectly.  Licensee may not
  allow anyone other than a Licensed Developer to use the Licensed
  Software or Documentation for the development of Applications or
  allow Licensed Developers to use the Licensed Software or
  Documentation for any purpose except for the development of
  Applications.

3.2 Use Restrictions.
  The use rights granted to Licensee in Section 2.2 may only be
  exercised by individuals employed by or under contract to Licensee
  that Licensee has designated as "Licensed Users" and for whom
  Licensee has paid the applicable license fees and on specific
  computing devices owned or leased by Licensee or contractors under
  Licensee's control, located at facilities owned or leased by
  Licensee or contractors under Licensee's control that Licensee has
  designated as "Licensed Devices" and for which Licensee has paid the
  applicable license fees.  Licensee must license every device which
  runs, provides data to, uses services provided by, or otherwise
  accesses Applications containing the Licensed Software.  Licensee
  may not install Applications on back-up or fail-over computers
  without paying the applicable fees for such computers.
  Notwithstanding any license management mechanisms used by the
  Licensed Software, Licensee is responsible for ensuring that the
  Licensed Software is not used by users or on computing devices in
  excess of those for which Licensee has paid the applicable fees.
  Individual User license rights may only be exercised by individuals
  employed by or under contract to Licensee for whom Licensee has paid
  the applicable per product Individual User license fees.  If an
  Individual User ceases to be employed by or under contract to
  Licensee or permanently ceases work on projects involving the
  Licensed Software, then Licensee may designate an alternate
  individual to replace such Individual User at no additional cost.
  However, the Individual User license is not a concurrent license
  that may be used by more than one individual in shifts.  Concurrent
  User license rights may only be exercised by individuals employed by
  or under contract to Licensee and for whom Licensee has paid the
  applicable per product Concurrent User license fees.  Licensee must
  ensure that no more than the maximum number of licensed Concurrent
  Users is using the Licensed Software at any one time.  Academic User
  license rights may only be exercised by a teacher or student at an
  accredited institution organized and operated exclusively for the
  purpose of teaching its enrolled students (e.g., a university,
  college or high school), which has been granted a discount to
  authorize such person to use the Licensed Software solely for
  student instruction and learning.  Academic discounts are not
  available for satellite organizations such as research laboratories
  and hospitals.

3.3 Distribution Restrictions.
  Except as may be otherwise specified in a written addendum to this
  License Agreement executed by Rogue Wave, Licensee has no right to
  copy for distribution, distribute or permit deployment of the
  Licensed Software or Applications on computers or at facilities not
  owned or leased by Licensee or contractors under Licensee's
  control.

3.4 General Use Limitations.
  All rights not specifically granted herein are retained by Rogue
  Wave.  Licensee may not, nor may Licensee permit any other person or
  entity to use, copy, modify, or distribute the Licensed Software
  (electronically or otherwise), or any copy, adaptation,
  transcription, or merged portion thereof, or the Documentation
  except as expressly authorized by Rogue Wave.  Licensee may not
  modify or port the Licensed Software to operate on or deploy the
  Licensed Software or Applications on platforms other than those for
  which it has paid the appropriate fees.  Licensee may not, nor may
  Licensee permit any other person or entity to, reverse assemble,
  reverse compile, or otherwise translate any binary forms of the
  Licensed Software, except to the extent applicable laws specifically
  prohibit such restriction. Licensee's rights may not be transferred,
  leased, assigned, or sublicensed except for a transfer of the
  License Agreement in its entirety to (1) a successor in interest of
  Licensee's entire business who assumes the obligations of this
  License Agreement or (2) any other party who is reasonably
  acceptable to Rogue Wave, enters into a substitute version of this
  License Agreement, and pays an administrative fee intended to cover
  attendant costs. No service bureau work, multiple-user license, or
  time-sharing arrangement is permitted, except as expressly
  authorized by Rogue Wave.  If Licensee uses, copies, or modifies the
  Licensed Software or transfers possession of any copy, adaptation,
  transcription, or merged portion thereof to any other party in any
  way not expressly authorized by Rogue Wave, all licenses under this
  License Agreement are automatically terminated.

3.5 Proprietary Protection.
  Rogue Wave shall have sole and exclusive ownership of all right,
  title, and interest in and to the Licensed Software and all
  modifications and enhancements thereof (including ownership of all
  trade secrets and copyrights pertaining thereto), subject only to
  the rights and privileges expressly granted to Licensee herein by
  Rogue Wave.  This License Agreement does not provide Licensee with
  title or ownership of the Licensed Software, but only a right of
  limited use. Licensee must keep the Licensed Software free and clear
  of all claims, liens, and encumbrances.

3.6 Compliance Verification.
  Licensee must have a commercially-reasonable process in place to
  track the usage of the Licensed Software in order to ensure that the
  appropriate license fees have been paid under this License
  Agreement.  Licensee will, upon Rogue Wave's request, certify in
  writing its usage of Licensed Software.  In the event Licensee fails
  to provide such certification within thirty (30) days of Rogue
  Wave's request, or, if Rogue Wave reasonably believes that a
  certification provided by Licensee is inaccurate, Licensee will
  permit Rogue Wave, or a mutually-approved independent
  representative, to enter Licensee's premises, during regular
  business hours, to verify Licensee's compliance with the terms of
  this License Agreement.

3.7 Confidentiality.
  Licensee agrees that all material and information relating to the
  Licensed Software is made available for use solely under and in
  accordance with the terms and conditions of this License
  Agreement. Licensee has no right at any time during or after
  cancellation or termination of this License Agreement to disclose
  such material and/or information relating to the Licensed Software,
  whether directly or indirectly, to any third party without Rogue
  Wave's prior written approval. Licensee shall hold harmless, defend
  and indemnify Rogue Wave from and against any and all losses, costs,
  damages and expenses arising out of or in connection with Licensee's
  failure to comply with requirements of this Section.

3.8 Development of Applications.
  The Licensed Software is intended for use by sophisticated
  developers.  Licensee is responsible for selecting persons who are
  qualified to use the Licensed Software on Licensee's own equipment
  and are familiar with the Licensed Software.  Licensee is also
  responsible for ensuring a proper environment and proper utilities
  for the development and execution of Applications utilizing the
  Licensed Software.  Licensee represents that it has the requisite
  expertise to evaluate the suitability of the Licensed Software and
  that it has undertaken its own investigation of the suitability of
  the Licensed Software in the Applications. Licensee represents that
  it has relied upon its own skill and judgment in selecting the
  Licensed Software and developing the Applications.

3.9 Relationship with End Users.
  There are no third party beneficiaries to this License Agreement.
  Consequently, Rogue Wave provides no warranty at all to any person,
  other than the limited warranty provided to Licensee hereunder.
  Licensee will be solely responsible for the development of the
  Applications authorized by this License Agreement and for providing
  all support or services required or requested by end users of the
  Applications. Licensee will not make any representations or
  warranties to its employees, customers, end users or any other third
  party on Rogue Wave's behalf.  Rogue Wave assumes no responsibility
  under this License Agreement, either directly or indirectly, for
  damages to Licensee or third parties resulting from the direct or
  indirect use of the Applications created by or on behalf of
  Licensee.

3.10 Remedies.
  Licensee acknowledges that, in the event of Licensee's breach of any
  of the foregoing provisions, Rogue Wave will not have an adequate
  remedy in money or damages.  Rogue Wave will therefore be entitled
  to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court of
  competent jurisdiction immediately upon request without posting a
  bond.  Rogue Wave's right to obtain injunctive relief shall not
  limit its right to seek further remedies.


4. MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF LICENSED SOFTWARE.

   Rogue Wave or its authorized resellers shall provide Maintenance
and Support on the Licensed Software at the level and for the period
for which Licensee has paid the applicable fees.  Maintenance and
Support services provided by Rogue Wave are provided in accordance
with Rogue Wave's standard maintenance and support and obsolescence
policies, which are subject to change.  Maintenance and Support is
limited to platforms listed on Rogue Wave's current product support
matrix, which is also subject to change.  Licensee is responsible for
ensuring that its environment is on the current product support
matrix.  Off-matrix support is available from Rogue Wave for an
additional fee.  Unless otherwise specified in a quote generated by
Rogue Wave, at the end of the initial maintenance and support term,
Maintenance and Support will automatically renew for successive terms
of one (1) year subject to Licensee's acceptance of Rogue Wave's or
its authorized reseller's then-current fees, unless notice of
non-renewal is given by either party no less than thirty (30) days
before expiration of the term.  Licensee will be deemed to have
accepted Rogue Wave's or its authorized reseller's then-current fees
for any successive term unless Licensee gives notice to Rogue Wave or
its authorized reseller (as applicable) of its rejection of any
increase in fees no later than thirty (30) days after Licensee
receives notice thereof.


5. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

5.1 Limited Warranty.
  Rogue Wave warrants to Licensee and for Licensee's benefit only that
  the unaltered Licensed Software, when used as permitted under the
  License Agreement and in accordance with the instructions in the
  Documentation, will operate substantially as described in the
  Documentation for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of
  delivery (the "Software Warranty Period"). Rogue Wave does not
  warrant that use of the Licensed Software will be uninterrupted or
  error-free, that all errors will be corrected, or that use of the
  Licensed Software will meet Licensee's needs. Rogue Wave will, at
  its own expense and as its sole obligation and Licensee's sole and
  exclusive remedy for any breach of this warranty, use commercially
  reasonable efforts to correct any reproducible error in the Licensed
  Software reported to Rogue Wave by Licensee in writing during the
  Software Warranty Period; provided, however, that no such error
  correction provided to Licensee will extend the original Software
  Warranty Period. If Rogue Wave determines that it is unable to
  correct the error, Rogue Wave may, upon approval by Licensee, refund
  to Licensee the fees paid by the Licensee for the defective Licensed
  Software and terminate the License Agreement and all licenses
  granted herein. In the event Licensee does not approve of such
  refund and termination of the License Agreement, Licensee will be
  entitled to keep the Licensed Software and use it pursuant to the
  licenses granted herein; provided, however, that Rogue Wave will not
  be obligated to provide Maintenance and Support for the Licensed
  Software that is impacted by the reported defect.

5.2 Exclusions.
  The limited warranty set forth above will not apply to defects
  resulting from, or because of, modifications made to the Licensed
  Software by anyone other than Rogue Wave, misuse, failure of media
  not furnished by Rogue Wave, operation with media, software or
  equipment not authorized by Rogue Wave in the Documentation or not
  meeting or not maintained in accordance with the supplier's
  specifications, or causes other than ordinary use. The warranty set
  forth above will not be enlarged, diminished or affected by, and no
  obligation or liability will arise from, Rogue Wave's rendering of
  technical advice, assistance or service in connection with
  Licensee's selection or use of the Licensed Software.  Certain open
  source or other-vendor software may be distributed with the Licensed
  Software or recommended in connection with its installation and use.
  Such products are provided or recommended for Licensee's convenience
  only.  Rogue Wave makes no representation or warranty of any kind
  regarding such products.  Rogue Wave offers no support for such
  products and shall have no liability associated with their use.
  Licensee's use of these products shall be in accordance with the
  licenses for such products, copies of which are included with the
  products and/or in the Rogue Wave documentation.

5.3 DISCLAIMER.
  EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 5.1 ABOVE, THE
  LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. ROGUE WAVE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
  PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND
  NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF
  PERFORMANCE OR COURSE OF DEALING.

5.4 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
  THE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF ROGUE WAVE TO LICENSEE FOR ALL CLAIMS
  RELATING TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT,
  INCLUDING ANY CAUSE OF ACTION SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR STRICT
  LIABILITY, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALL LICENSE FEES
  PAID TO ROGUE WAVE HEREUNDER. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS
  INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS
  LICENSE AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE.
  ROGUE WAVE SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF DATA OR
  DOCUMENTATION, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT LICENSEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
  REASONABLE BACK-UP PRECAUTIONS.  IN NO EVENT SHALL ROGUE WAVE BE
  LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS; ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR ANY CLAIMS OR DEMANDS BROUGHT AGAINST
  LICENSEE, EVEN IF ROGUE WAVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH CLAIMS OR DEMANDS. THIS LIMITATION UPON DAMAGES AND CLAIMS IS
  INTENDED TO APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS
  LICENSE AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN BREACHED OR HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE.
  LICENSEE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER CERTAIN LAWS (E.G.,
  CONSUMER LAWS) THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF
  SUCH LAWS APPLY, CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO
  LICENSEE; HOWEVER, ALL OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL
  REMAIN IN EFFECT.


6. INDEMNIFICATION.

  Rogue Wave agrees to defend Licensee from and against any third
party claims alleging that the Licensed Software furnished and used
within the scope of this Agreement infringes or misappropriates a
U.S. patent issued as of the Effective Date, copyright, trademark or
trade secret and will pay all final judgments awarded or settlements
entered into on such claims.  The foregoing indemnity obligation shall
not extend to any claims of infringement arising out of or related to
(i) a modification of a Licensed Software by anyone other than Rogue
Wave or its duly authorized agent; (ii) the incorporation into the
Licensed Software of any information provided by or requested by
Licensee; (iii) a combination of the Licensed Software with any third
party software or equipment not specified in the Documentation and
where such combination is the cause of such infringement; or (iv) the
use of a version of a Licensed Software other than the then-current
version if the infringement would have been avoided by using of the
then-current version.  In the event the Licensed Software is held or
is believed by Rogue Wave to infringe, Rogue Wave may, at its sole
option and expense, elect to (a) modify the Licensed Software so that
it is non-infringing; (b) replace the Licensed Software with
non-infringing Licensed Software which is functionally equivalent; (c)
obtain a license for Licensee to continue to use the Licensed Software
as provided hereunder; or if none of (a), (b), or (c) is commercially
reasonable, then (d) terminate the license for the infringing Licensed
Software and refund the license fees paid for that Licensed Software,
prorated over a five (5) year term from the Effective Date.  THIS
SECTION 6 STATES ROGUE WAVE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND LICENSEE'S SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY PROPRIETARY
RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.  Rogue Wave's indemnification obligations under
this Section 6 are conditioned upon the Licensee (a) giving prompt
notice of the claim to Rogue Wave; (b) granting sole control of the
defense or settlement of the claim or action to Rogue Wave; and (c)
providing reasonable cooperation to Rogue Wave and, at Rogue Wave's
request and expense, assistance in the defense or settlement of the
claim.


7. TERMINATION.

7.1 Term.
  The term of this License Agreement will begin as of the date that
  Licensee receives the Licensed Software and will remain in effect
  perpetually unless terminated under this Section 7.

7.2 Termination for Convenience.
  Licensee may terminate this License Agreement for any reason, or for
  no reason, by giving Rogue Wave thirty (30) days written notice.

7.3 Termination for Cause.
  Rogue Wave may terminate this License Agreement if Licensee breaches
  its obligations hereunder.  Rogue Wave will effect such termination
  by giving Licensee notice of termination, specifying therein the
  alleged breach.  If the breach is curable, Licensee will have a
  grace period of thirty (30) days after such notice is served to cure
  the breach described therein.  If the breach is cured within the
  thirty (30) day grace period, then this License Agreement will
  remain in effect; otherwise, this License Agreement will
  automatically terminate upon the conclusion of the thirty (30) day
  grace period.

7.4 Effect of Termination.
  Upon termination of the License Agreement for any reason the
  following terms shall apply:  (a) all rights granted under this
  License Agreement will immediately terminate and Licensee must
  immediately stop all use of the Licensed Software; (b) Licensee must
  return to Rogue Wave or destroy all copies of the Licensed Software
  provided to or made by or on behalf of Licensee, and will, within
  ten (10) days after the effective date of termination, provide Rogue
  Wave with written certification that all such copies have been
  returned or destroyed; and (c) all provisions of this License
  Agreement with the exception of the licenses granted in Section 2
  and Maintenance and Support obligations set forth in Section 4 will
  survive termination of this License Agreement for any reason.
  Termination of the License Agreement will not affect Licensee's
  obligation to pay all amounts accrued hereunder prior to the
  effective date of termination.  Licensee agrees that the termination
  of this Agreement by Rogue Wave can never entail liability for Rogue
  Wave to pay damages to Licensee for anticipated or missing profits
  that could otherwise have arisen through Licensee's use of the
  License.


8. MISCELLANEOUS.

8.1 Severability.
  If any term or provision of the License Agreement is found to be
  invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, then, that
  provision notwithstanding, the License Agreement will remain in full
  force and effect, and in such event, such provision will be changed
  and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such
  unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable
  law or applicable court decisions.

8.2 Governing Law/Forum Selection.
  The License Agreement and the parties' rights and obligations
  hereunder shall be solely and exclusively construed, interpreted and
  enforced under and in accordance with the laws of the State of
  Colorado, United States of America, without any reference to
  conflicts of law principles.  The parties agree that the
  U.N. Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply
  to the License Agreement.  Any and all disputes between the parties
  shall be brought and resolved solely and exclusively in the state or
  federal courts located in the State of Colorado, United States of
  America.  Both parties hereby irrevocably consent to the
  jurisdiction of such courts and service of process in connection
  therewith.  Any judgment rendered by such courts may be entered and
  enforced by any court having jurisdiction over the party against
  which an award is entered or its assets.  Both parties hereby
  irrevocably waive any objections to the jurisdiction of such courts
  based on any ground, including without limitation improper venue or
  forum non conveniens.

8.3 No Joint Venture.
  Nothing contained in the License Agreement will be construed so as
  to make the parties partners or joint venturers or to permit either
  party to bind the other party to any agreement or purport to act on
  behalf of the other party in any respect.

8.4 Waiver and Modifications.
  Failure by Rogue Wave to enforce any rights under this License
  Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of such rights, and a
  waiver in one or more instances will not be construed as
  constituting a continuing waiver or as a waiver in other instances.
  No modification of this License Agreement shall be binding unless it
  is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative of the
  party against whom enforcement of the modification is sought.

8.5 Import/Export Law.
  Licensee may not import, use or otherwise export or re-export the
  Licensed Software except as authorized by United States law and the
  laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Software was
  obtained.

8.6 Taxes.
  License fees and Maintenance and Support fees are exclusive of, and
  Licensee will pay, all shipping charges and all taxes, duties and
  other charges or fees imposed by governmental authorities arising
  out of the License Agreement or the use of the Licensed Software by
  Licensee.  In addition, if any Licensed Software will be delivered
  to points outside of the United States, all export duties, import
  duties, tariffs, value added taxes, licenses and other similar
  taxes, duties and fees will be paid by Licensee.  If Licensee is
  required by the laws of any jurisdiction to deduct or withhold from
  any payment to Rogue Wave any income taxes which may be levied
  against Rogue Wave, then Licensee's payment shall be increased to an
  amount equal to the pre-tax payment due divided by a factor equal to
  one minus the applicable foreign tax rate.  The tax shall then be
  applied to and deducted from the increased payment.

8.7 U.S. Government Rights.
  The Licensed Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined
  at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and
  "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used
  in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
  C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users
  acquire the Licensed Software with only those rights set forth in
  this License Agreement.  The software licensed to civilian agencies
  is licensed with Restricted Rights pursuant to FAR 52.227-19.

8.8 English Language.
  The parties hereto have expressly required that the present License
  Agreement be drawn up in the English language.
  Les parties présentes ont expressément exigé que la présente
  Convention soit rédigée en langue anglaise.


9. EVALUATION LICENSE.

of the evaluation license You are required to return or destroy, as
requested by Rogue Wave, all copies of the software in your possession
and all other materials pertaining to the Software, including all

requirement upon Rogue Wave's request.  Software provided under an
